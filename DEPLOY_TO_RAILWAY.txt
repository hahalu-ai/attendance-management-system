  🚀 DEPLOY TO RAILWAY - FIXED & READY!
================================================================================

ISSUE FIXED: The path error is now resolved. The Dockerfile automatically
handles the migration!

================================================================================
  DEPLOY IN 2 STEPS:
================================================================================

STEP 1: Push to GitHub
-----------------------
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment with automatic migration"
git push origin main


STEP 2: Watch Railway Deploy
-----------------------------
Go to your Railway dashboard and watch the logs.

You should see:
  ✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
  * Serving Flask app 'app'
  * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5001


That's it! Your three-tier system is now live! 🎉

================================================================================
  WHAT CHANGED:
================================================================================

✅ Dockerfile now runs migration automatically before starting server
✅ No manual start command configuration needed
✅ Migration is safe to run on every deployment (idempotent)
✅ All documentation updated with correct paths

================================================================================
  VERIFY IT WORKS:
================================================================================

1. Open your Railway app URL
2. You should see three portals:
   - Manager Portal
   - Lead Portal
   - Member QR Scanner

3. Test the flow:
   - Login as Manager
   - Create a Lead
   - Login as Lead
   - Create a Member
   - Generate QR code
   - Scan with mobile!

================================================================================
  TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

Q: Still getting path errors?
A: Make sure you pushed the updated Dockerfile to GitHub

Q: "Migration already completed" in logs?

   The server will start normally.

Q: Database connection error?
A: Check that MySQL service is running in Railway dashboard

Q: Need more help?
A: Check RAILWAY_FIX.md for detailed troubleshooting
